license=\nEclipse Public License - v 1.0\n\nTHE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE\nPUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF\nTHE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\n\n*1. DEFINITIONS*\n\n"Contribution" means\:\n\na) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and\ndocumentation distributed under this Agreement, and\n\nb) in the case of each subsequent Contributor\:\n\ni) changes to the Program, and\n\nii) additions to the Program;\n\nwhere such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and\nare distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution\n'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such\nContributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.\nContributions do not include additions to the Program which\: (i) are\nseparate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program\nunder their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of\nthe Program.\n\n"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\n\n"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which\nare necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone\nor when combined with the Program.\n\n"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this\nAgreement.\n\n"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,\nincluding all Contributors.\n\n*2. GRANT OF RIGHTS*\n\na) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\ngrants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright\nlicense to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,\npublicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such\nContributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and\nobject code form.\n\nb) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\ngrants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license\nunder Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and\notherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in\nsource code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the\ncombination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the\nContribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the\nContribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed\nPatents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations\nwhich include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\n\nc) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the\nlicenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are\nprovided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the\npatent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each\nContributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by\nany other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights\nor otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses\ngranted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to\nsecure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For\nexample, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient\nto distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire\nthat license before distributing the Program.\n\nd) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient\ncopyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright\nlicense set forth in this Agreement.\n\n*3. REQUIREMENTS*\n\nA Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form\nunder its own license agreement, provided that\:\n\na) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\n\nb) its license agreement\:\n\ni) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties\nand conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions\nof title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of\nmerchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;\n\nii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for\ndamages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and\nconsequential damages, such as lost profits;\n\niii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are\noffered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\n\niv) states that source code for the Program is available from such\nContributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable\nmanner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\n\nWhen the Program is made available in source code form\:\n\na) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\n\nb) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.\n\nContributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained\nwithin the Program.\n\nEach Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its\nContribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent\nRecipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.\n\n*4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION*\n\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities\nwith respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this\nlicense is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the\nContributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering\nshould do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for\nother Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in\na commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial\nContributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other\nContributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and\ncosts (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other\nlegal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified\nContributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such\nCommercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the\nProgram in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this\nsection do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or\nalleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an\nIndemnified Contributor must\: a) promptly notify the Commercial\nContributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial\nContributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor\nin, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified\nContributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.\n\nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial\nproduct offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial\nContributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance\nclaims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance\nclaims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility\nalone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to\ndefend claims against the other Contributors related to those\nperformance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other\nContributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor\nmust pay those damages.\n\n*5. NO WARRANTY*\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED\nON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND,\nEITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES\nOR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR\nA PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for\ndetermining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program\nand assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this\nAgreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program\nerrors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,\nprograms or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\n\n*6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY*\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR\nANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,\nINCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING\nWITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF\nLIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING\nNEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR\nDISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED\nHEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n*7. GENERAL*\n\nIf any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\napplicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\nthe remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action\nby the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum\nextent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\nIf Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including\na cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program\nitself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or\nhardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's\nrights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such\nlitigation is filed.\n\nAll Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails\nto comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement\nand does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after\nbecoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under\nthis Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution\nof the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's\nobligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient\nrelating to the Program shall continue and survive.\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,\nbut in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may\nonly be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves\nthe right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this\nAgreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has\nthe right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the\ninitial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the\nresponsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate\nentity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing\nversion number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be\ndistributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was\nreceived. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is\npublished, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including\nits Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in\nSections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses\nto the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement,\nwhether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in\nthe Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\n\nThis Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the\nintellectual property laws of the United States of America.
